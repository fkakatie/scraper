# Quarry: A Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson Resource #

Scraping GQ to bring the best of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to you! :muscle:

## What this project does ## 

This web app lets users view and leave comments on the latest Dwayne Johnson news by scraping the GQ website with `Cheerio` and storing these articles (and comments) in a `MongoDB` using `Mongoose`. Stories are positioned on page using `Masonry`.
